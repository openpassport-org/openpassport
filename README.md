# Embassy

Monorepo for Embassy, a proof of passport protocol.

Embassy lets users scan the NFC chip in their government-issued passport.

If the signature is valid, the user can generate a proof that can be verified onchain.

We are using that proof to mint them a Soulbound Token (SBT) they can use to show that they indeed hold
an official passport.

Users can also selectively disclose personal info like their nationality or their date of birth.
