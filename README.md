Monorepo for the Proof of Passport protocol.

Proof of Passport lets users scan the NFC chip in their government-issued passport.
If the signature is valid, the user can generate a proof that can be verified onchain.
We are using that proof to mint them a Soulbound Token (SBT) they can use to show that they indeed hold
an official passport.
Users can also selectively disclose personal info like their nationality or their date of birth.
